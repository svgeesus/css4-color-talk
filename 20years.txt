The Prehistoric Web

1994

Indexed-color displays. 16 color VGA. 256 color if you were fancy.
"True-color" for the lucky few.

Gamma is all over the place
Apple 2.5/1.45=1.72, SGI 2.4/1.7 = 1.4, and everyone else 2.2

W3C Print Workshop 1996
sRGB proposal

Hope was that sRGB covers the low end and ICC covers the high end
Macs had CM 
Windows, Linux did not
then PCs got CM that sort of worked
then they got CM that was better (but not ICC based)
Linux-Gnome got CM 
Linux-KDE got CM 

success!

Mobile comes along

no CM

SVG Color 
2009
https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGColor12/





ICC color gets added to SVG 2

all color stuff gets removed from SVG2, references CSS3 Color

what is different now
what changed

Adobe RGB and the SLR crowd
(too specialized)
P3 and Apple
Wide gamut, HDR TV/movies
Mobile CMS


P3 and Apple
suddenly the cool thing
ignores P3 whitepoint though
ignores P3 gamma though

P3 and everyone else
for movies, with 2.6 gamma



CSS Color 4
2015 onwards

FPWD July 2016

Lack of review
ColorWeb cg 
W3C joins ICC


Working color space
sRGB for Web Compat, but add other values
scRGB (but scene referred); Lab?

Compositing
in gamma-encoded rather than linear space, because Photoshop compatibility

challenges
color management in VR/AR
HDR for video and images (stills/HDR photo)

online purchases returned due to unwanted color
